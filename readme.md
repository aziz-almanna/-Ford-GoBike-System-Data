# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Abdulaziz Almanna


## Dataset

> his document explores a dataset including time, stations, and users' attributes for 183412 trips, This review looks at the Ford GoBike travel statistics for public bike rides in the Bay Area from January to December 2019. 



## Summary of Findings
This is what I found after analyzing this data

- The majority of bike riders are capable of utilizing their bikes for short-distance trips around 10 mins
- with a peak between the ages of 26 and 31, and the number of users falls as they get older.
- This, predictably, corresponds to our first histogram visual, in which the majority of the rides appear to be centered around the early 30's age range.
- We note that the number of trips for men is three times more than women
-  On the two days off, Saturday and Sunday, the duration of the trips is longer for everyone, unlike working days, females always spend more time than male on trips


## Key Insights for Presentation

>  We can see from the pointplot that female members have a substantially longer journey time than the other genders, This surprised me because males often have more stamina
> There is a relationship between the duration of bicycle trips on two days, Sunday and Saturday, but the rest of the days are at the normal rate
